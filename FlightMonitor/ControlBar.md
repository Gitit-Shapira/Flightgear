### Description

This class will allow the user, after loading the flight data, to skip any time on the flight using a control similar to the scroll bar in the youtube videos.
The user will be able to move the control forward or backward whenever he wants, and a view
The plane (along with additional data views) will skip to this time and continue the flight movie from there. In addition, we will allow it to override the screen, stop reading the data, and restart.

In addition, we would like to allow the user to watch at high speeds various flight segments where nothing happened, and thus focus on critical flight segments to watch at very low speeds to the point of stopping. Therefore, this is realized with the help of a dedicated control that will control this rhythm called Play Speed

Let's go over the available features in the control bar:

- Stop button - When the Stop button is pressed, the flight is being frozen, but now by clicking the Play button the flight will start from the beginning.
- Play button - Use the Play button to resume the flight after the Stop or Pause button was clicked.
- Pause button - Pauses the flight.
- Slider - Allow you to move the tick along with the slider, and then the flight will jump to the corresponding time CSV line according to its position you chose.
- Play speed - Allow to set the speed of the flight by selecting an option in the right corner drop-down button called Play Speed.
